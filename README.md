# Perfume-Product
Hello everyone, I am Carlos I Zuniga. This here is my take on a challenge from frontend mentor.

This perfume product is a coding challenge from frontend mentor. It's a website designed to help developers improve their skills.
The product on display is a Chanel perfume card created with simple HTML and CSS; the card itself doesn't have much but does display
a button that should change color when hovered over it. In this challenge, most of the HTML code I was able to write on my own; the
issues for me arrive on the display of the image. I had to investigate and learn about the overflow property, the source tag, and the srcset property.
In my investigating I came across Kenvin Podwell on YouTube. He is a web developer who post videos on CSS tips and tricks. With the help of his video
I managed to finish the perfume product card. I wanted to keep most of my original code and only add what I needed and not copy and paste code from Kevin's videos.
I feel that the most effective way to progress in becoming a frontend developer is to create from the knowledge I have and grow in the areas I lack.
Thus far the only issues I have is in the size of the button. When the button is in mobile form the button is very thin and long; when the button is
in desktop form the button is wide with alot of padding. I would really appreciate any advice on how to solve this issue from anyone who comes across it
